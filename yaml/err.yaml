ForeignCharInTag:
  type: SyntaxError 
  message: The character '{cchar}' is invalid in a tag
  tooltip: Did you forget to close your tag? Only logic characters for operators, and alphanumeric and underscore characters for names, are allowed in a tag.  
  code: 200
EqualsNotValidCharacter:
  type: SyntaxError
  message: The character '=' is only valid in a tag when used in '=>'
  tooltip: Unlike HTML, eno handles assignment with colons (:), not equal signs. Maybe you meant to use one of those?
  code: 200
OpeningMultipleTags:
  type: LexemeOrderError
  message: You cannot create a new tag inside of an existing tag
  tooltip: You may have forgot to put a closing bracket before opening a new one. Alternatively, if you're trying to nest tags, something like <foo <bar>> is invalid syntax. You may have meant <foo><bar>?
  code: 200
TagEmpty:
  type: TagConventionError
  message: Your tag contains no name
  tooltip: You forgot to specify a name for your tag. Whitespace is not considered a valid name, and is stripped at runtime.
  code: 200
ClosingTypedef:
  type: TagConventionError
  message: You cannot both create and close a tag
  tooltip: When you use '!', you're specifying that you're closing a tag (much like HTML's '/'.) When you use +, you're specifying that you're creating a new tag, usually in <format>. If you want to create a new tag and then close it, it can be done like <+ foo><!bar>, but at no point would you use '+!'.
  code: 200
ClosingDemitag:
  type: TagConventionError
  message: You cannot close a demitag, by definition
  tooltip: When you use & in a tag, you're denoting that it doesn't close, sort of like HTML's <br> tags. I call these demitags, because it makes etymological sense, and also sounds cool. By definition, closing a demitag with '!' is impossible, synonymous with something like </br> in HTML.
  code: 200
EventNotValidName:
  type: TagConventionError
  message: You cannot use an event as a name
  tooltip: "An 'event' is text that starts with @. Events are usually used in things like buttons, so that you can say '@on_press : $foo', and the like. Any lone event is interpreted as an attempt to assign the name of your tag, and a tag named after an event is invalid. Maybe you forgot to add an equality, or simply tried to name your tag an event?"
  code: 200
MultipleNamesInvalid:
  type: TagConventionError
  message: A tag can have only one name
  tooltip: You tried to give a tag multiple names, but only one is valid. Any standalone text is interpreted as a name, so maybe you forgot to assign an equality? Spaces denote the end of a name in eno, so using them in the name of your tag is also invalid.
  code: 200
TagAlreadyMarked:
  type: TagConventionWarning
  message: You repeated {char} twice
  tooltip: Defining characters, like '+' '&' and '!', are only valid when used once (preferably at the beginning) of a tag.
  code: 200
CharacterOrder:
  type: TagConventionWarning
  message: Defining characters like {char} should be before your tag name
  tooltip: Having defining characters at the beginning of your tag is preferred syntax
  code: 100
InvalidTagClosing:
  type: DomOrderError
  message: Unable to close tag
  tooltip: You failed to close the currently open tag, '{copen}', and instead tried to close '{cclose}'. You need to close '{copen}' first.
  code: 200

NoArgumentsSpecified:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: You didn't specify any arguments with which to run eno
  tooltip: If you're installing this for the first time, try running "eno install". If you want to see a list of all arguments, use "eno help".
  code: 200
InvalidArgument:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: '"{arg}" is not a valid argument'
  tooltip: To get a list of all arguments, use "eno help"
  code: 200
NoMoreArgumentsPossible:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: '"{arg}" could not be added because there are no more possible arguments'
  tooltip: You've reached the maximum number of arguments, which is usually 1. Maybe you meant to use an optional argument prefixing this one, denoted like "--foo"? If you're unsure, use "eno help" to see what arguments are valid in this command.
  code: 200
CommandLineIntegerInvalid:
  type: TypeError
  message: '"{arg}" is not a valid integer'
  tooltip: Integers cannot contain decimals, and are unsigned (no negative signs are valid.) Are you sure you meant to put an integer there?
  code: 200
IntegerOutOfRange:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: 'The integer you used, "{arg}", is not within the range of {arg2} required for this argument'
  tooltip: '"eno help --cmd [command name]" can give you more information about optional paramaters like this'
  code: 200
NotEnoughArguments:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: "You didn't include enough arguments ({arg} required)"
  tooltip: 'When you run, for example "eno foo -bar a", a is an argument of the optional paramater bar, and only foo is an argument of the main command. Maybe you messed up somewhere there?'
  code: 200
OptionalArgumentLeftOpen:
  type: CommandLineError
  message: 'You forgot to specify a value for the "{arg}" paramater'
  tooltip: Some flags, like --visible, don't require anything after them. They turn stuff on and off. The flag you used isn't one of those. It requires something after it for the parser to actually make sense of it, like '--color red'. By itself, something like '--color' is useless.
